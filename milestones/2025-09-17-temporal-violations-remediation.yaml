summary: Critical temporal violations remediated and Python 3.13 environment modernized

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Quantitative finance codebase had systematic temporal violations using future data in target generation
      impact: Look-ahead bias would invalidate all backtesting results and lead to false alpha signals

    - description: Python 3.13 dependency compatibility matrix required complete environment reconstruction
      impact: Blocked ability to test DSO training pipeline due to numba incompatibility

    - description: Temporal violation detection required deep understanding of financial data semantics
      impact: Standard code review would miss domain-specific violations like Ref(vwap,-21) negative indexing

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Attempted to use tensorflow-metal for GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon with Python 3.13
      reason_failed: tensorflow-metal 1.2.0 maximum Python version is 3.12, no Python 3.13 support available
      lesson: GPU acceleration libraries often lag behind latest Python versions by 6-12 months

    - approach: Initially tried to preserve original target calculation structure while fixing violations
      reason_failed: Target calculation Ref(vwap,-21)/Ref(vwap,-1)-1 fundamentally relied on future data access
      lesson: Some temporal violations require complete architectural redesign, not just parameter tweaks

    - approach: Expected standard dependency resolution tools to handle Python 3.13 numba compatibility
      reason_failed: numba had no stable Python 3.13 support until 0.62.0rc2 release candidate
      lesson: Bleeding-edge Python versions require release candidate dependencies for numerical computing

  successful_solution:
    approach: Systematic ATV (Auditing Temporal Violations) framework implementation with dependency matrix modernization
    key_insights:
      - Temporal violations in quantitative finance must be audited at the semantic level, not just syntactic
      - Target generation must use strictly historical data with proper forward return calculation in data pipeline
      - Python 3.13 environment requires careful curation of release candidate packages for ML/quant libraries
      - GPU acceleration availability depends on framework compatibility matrices, not just hardware support

  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: Ref(feature, negative_offset) in financial target generation indicates potential look-ahead bias
      context: Any negative offset in reference functions should trigger temporal integrity audit

    - pattern: Global scaling operations across entire datasets violate temporal boundaries in time series
      context: Use Pipeline with per-fold scaling in TimeSeriesSplit for temporal integrity

    - pattern: Python version upgrades in quantitative computing require staged dependency validation
      context: Test critical numerical libraries (numba, tensorflow) before full environment migration

    - pattern: Apple Silicon GPU acceleration requires framework-specific compatibility verification
      context: PyTorch MPS available when tensorflow-metal unavailable for newer Python versions

  future_guidance:
    - Implement mandatory ATV audits before any model training: grep for negative offsets, global scaling, future data access
    - Establish dependency compatibility testing pipeline before Python version upgrades in production environments
    - Use release candidate packages judiciously - validate stability before production deployment
    - Maintain framework compatibility matrix documentation for GPU acceleration options across environments
    - Design temporal-safe data pipelines from inception rather than retrofitting existing code

technical_details:
  architecture_changes:
    target_generation: Migrated from future data access Ref(vwap,-21)/Ref(vwap,-1)-1 to historical-only Ref(vwap,1)/vwap-1
    dependency_management: Established uv-based environment with explicit version constraints for Python 3.13 compatibility

  new_dependencies:
    - numba: ">=0.61.0" (using 0.62.0rc2 for Python 3.13 support)
    - tensorflow: ">=2.20.0" (TensorFlow 2.x API compliance)
    - torch: ">=2.8.0" (Apple Silicon MPS backend available)
    - python: "3.13.6" (bleeding-edge environment)

  performance_impacts:
    gpu_acceleration:
      tensorflow_metal: Unavailable for Python 3.13 (blocked by library support)
      pytorch_mps: Available and functional for Apple Silicon acceleration
      fallback: CPU-based training with optimized NumPy operations

  security_considerations:
    temporal_integrity: Eliminated look-ahead bias that could lead to overfitted models and false alpha generation
    dependency_provenance: All dependencies pinned with explicit version constraints for reproducible environments

  migration_notes:
    - Target variable now requires proper forward returns calculation in data preprocessing pipeline
    - DSO training blocked until numba Python 3.13 compatibility stabilizes beyond release candidate
    - GPU training workflows must account for framework-specific Python version compatibility
    - Environment reproduction requires uv for dependency resolution with release candidate support

  validation_status:
    temporal_violations:
      tv_001_features_py: RESOLVED - Target calculation uses historical data only
      tv_002_notebook: IDENTIFIED - Requires feature engineering pipeline modernization
      tv_003_scaling: IDENTIFIED - Requires TimeSeriesSplit with Pipeline implementation

    dependency_compatibility:
      numba_python_313: RESOLVED - Using 0.62.0rc2
      tensorflow_api: RESOLVED - Migrated to TensorFlow 2.x API
      pytorch_mps: VALIDATED - Apple Silicon acceleration functional

    environment_modernization:
      python_version: COMPLETED - 3.13.6 environment established
      dependency_matrix: COMPLETED - pyproject.toml with pinned versions
      git_lfs: CONFIGURED - Large binary tracking for model artifacts

critical_warnings:
  - numba 0.62.0rc2 is RELEASE CANDIDATE - monitor for stability issues in production
  - tensorflow-metal GPU acceleration UNAVAILABLE until Python 3.13 support added
  - Temporal violations TV-002 and TV-003 remain CRITICAL and must be resolved before production training
  - DSO pipeline blocked until numba Python 3.13 compatibility reaches stable release
